I created a variable for each of my biodata
I ran a print command for each variable

TASK ONE
I created a tool to translate RNA sequences into amino acids using the genetic code.
I simulated population growth with randomized lag and exponential phases.
I generated 100 unique growth curves to simulate variability in population dynamics.
I calculated the time it takes for a population to reach 80% of its maximum growth.
I measured the difference between my Slack username ("Eugenia") and X handle ("eugenia_ish").
